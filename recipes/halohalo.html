        <h2>What is Halo-Halo?</h2>
        <p>
            Halo-Halo is a Filipino dessert that consists of ube ice cream, shaved ice, condensed milk, jello, beans, and fruit.
            It is best enjoyed during the Summer months to help you cool down! It is a very free form dish so there's no right 
            way of preparing it.
